# Practice: Creating a Webpage using the basics of HTML focusing on Semantic HTML Elements

### Practice understanding the Header of a webpage

-   [ ] Simple practice to gain a better understanding of the purpose of the &lt;header&gt; elelment and what it entails
    -   [ ] Most sites have a space near the top of the webpage for certain information:
        -   [ ] A website logo
        -   [ ] The title of the webpage
        -   [ ] A search bar
        -   [ ] Some linkss that will navigate to other parts of the webpage
        -   [ ] Even a button to sign in or out of the webpage
-   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; element:
    -   [ ] Always goes in the &lt;body&gt; element
    -   [ ] It usually contains a header element: &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
    -   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; elelment is not the same as the &lt;head&gt; element outside of the &lt;body&gt; element
-   [ ] Since the header of a webpage tends to have links to navigate to other parts of the page, the &lt;nav&gt; element is used for this
-   [ ] The &lt;nav&gt; element:
    -   [ ] this element tends to containt ordered lists, unordered lists, or even the both types of lists
    -   [ ] For instance:
        -   [ ] A link with the #id-name of the desired section or part of the page would be in the "href" attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element for a list item
            -   [ ] &lt;a href="#about-section"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
                -   [ ] <a href="#about-section">About</a>
                -   [ ] When the user would click the About link they would then be directed to the About section of the page
